## Directory structure
-   **bin/** Contains all the binaries
-   **pkg/** Contains all the compiled files
-   **src/** Contains package source files

## Installing remote packages
- ```go get some_repo_name```
- To update the remote package ```go get -u some_repo_name```
- ```go get``` basically clones the remote repo and runs go install
- Packages can be imported by ```import "github.com/astaxie/beedb"```

## Some rudimentary commands
- ```go clean``` - This command is for cleaning files that are generated by compilers
- ```go build``` - This command is for compiling tests. It will compile packages and dependencies if it's necessary.
- ```go fmt``` - Lint for go
- ```go install``` - This command compiles all packages and generates files, then moves them to ```$GOPATH/pkg``` or ```$GOPATH/bin```.
- ```go test``` - This command loads all files whose name include *_test.go and generates test files, then prints information that looks like the following.

    ok   archive/tar   0.011s

    FAIL archive/zip   0.022s

    ok   compress/gzip 0.033s
- ```go list``` - List of installed packages
- ``` go run``` - Compile and run

## NOTES
- Every package should be in its own folder
- Importable functions should start with caps
- No private and public in go
- Every applicaiton should have one and only main package
